## RSNA Pneumonia Detection Kaggle Challenge

In this repo are notebooks and files from the RSNA Pneumonia Detection challenge. I tried a huge number of architectures and approaches but was only able to score a .176 on the leaderboard. 

The best performing model was the Mask_RCNN at size 320x320, although I suspect I could have beaten that score given more time or compute.
